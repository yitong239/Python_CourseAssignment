In this assignment1, I finished two things.



1. Part A Cleaning and EDA 

For the data cleaning part, I analyzed questions and based on the checking list below:

Data cleaning checklist

-Save original data

-Identify missing data

-Identify placeholder data (e.g. 0's for NA's)

-Identify outliers

-Check for overall plausibility and errors (e.g., typos, unreasonable ranges)

-Identify highly correlated variables

-Identify variables with (nearly) no variance

-Identify variables with strange names or values

-Check variable classes (eg. Characters vs factors)

-Remove/transform some variables (maybe your model does not like categorial variables)

-Rename some variables or values (if not all data is useful)

-Check some overall pattern (statistical/ numerical summaries)

-Possibly center/scale variables


And I also analyzed questions based on the criminal dataset I choosed.

-Are there missing values?

-Are there inappropraite values?

-Remove or impute any bad data.


Answerd the following questions for the data in each column:

-How is the data distributed?

-What are the summary statistics?

-Are there anomalies/outliers?

-Are any of the columns correlated?

-Plot each colmun as appropriate for the data type.

-Wrote a summary of what the plot tells me.




2. Part B Writing a web scraper 


For this assignment, I performed things below:

-Choosed a website and performed the web scraper, and wrote a function to check whether the link is valid 

-Collected all the external links in this website

-Associated the link with a textual description of it from the website.

-Saved the external links(urls), textual description, a boolean for valid, and the last vaild datetime check, 
 and import all of these information of linkes to an excel file.
