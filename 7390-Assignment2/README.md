In this assingment I clustered the data and created predictive linear and logistic models.

Clustered the data:
Used at least two methods to cluster the data. 
Answered the following questions for the clustering:

* Do the clustering methods generate the same clusters?
* Does scaling effect the clustering?  
* Does the clustering produce interesting groupings?  

Generated a linear model for the data:
Found a significant linear relation of my choosing in the data. Created a multivariate linear model. 
Answerd the following questions for the multivariate linear model:

* Is the relationship significant?   
* Are any model assumptions violated?   
* Is there any multi-colinearity in the model?   
* In the multiple regression models are predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?   
* In in multiple regression models rank the most significant predictor variables and exclude insignificant ones from the model.   
* Does the model make sense?  
* Cross-validate the model. How well did it do?      
* Does regularization help with creating models that validate better on out of sample data?   

Generated a logistic model for the data:

Find a significant logistic linear model of my choosing in the data. Created a logistic linear model. 
Answered the following questions for the logistic linear model:

* Is the relationship significant?  
* Are any model assumptions violated?   
* Cross-validate the model. How well did it do?
